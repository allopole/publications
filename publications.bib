              are hard to model and difficult to predict. Their dynamics might
              appear intractable. However, new statistical approaches-rooted in
              dynamical systems and the theory of stochastic processes-have
              yielded insight into the dynamics of emerging and re-emerging
              pathogens. We argue that these approaches may lead to new methods
              for predicting epidemics. This perspective views pathogen
              emergence and re-emergence as a ``critical transition,'' and uses
              the concept of noisy dynamic bifurcation to understand the
              relationship between the system observables and the distance to
              this transition. Because the system dynamics exhibit
              characteristic fluctuations in response to perturbations for a
              system in the vicinity of a critical point, we propose this
              information may be harnessed to develop early warning signals.
              Specifically, the motion of perturbations slows as the system
              approaches the transition.",

  abstract = "Epidemic transitions are an important feature of infectious
              disease systems. As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases,
              the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering
              chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One
              proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning
              signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic
              changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically
              predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the
              nature of epidemiological data, which are typically aggregated
              into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The
              viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains
              uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence
              even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance
              using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how
              well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an
              emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC
              statistic are compared across a range of different reporting
              scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data
              differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all
              perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The
              autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well
              provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than
              the serial interval and reporting error is not highly
              overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis
              are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we
              find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most
              realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect
              epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many
              potentially emerging diseases.",

                  collections: the reservoir, an active vent, and the
                  sea-surface. This was consistent with reservoir structures and

                  the spatial distribution of seep indicators such as bacteria
                  mats, or hydrate outcrops at the sediment interface, were
                  combined with known hydrocarbon fluxes from the literature and
                  used to quantify the total hydrocarbon fluxes in the seep
                  domain. Using a systems approach, we combined data sets and
                  published values at various scales and resolutions to compile
                  a preliminary hydrocarbon budget for the GC600 seep site.
                  Total estimated in-flow of hydrocarbons was 2.07 x 109 mol/yr.
                  The combined total of out-flow and sequestration amounted to
                  7.56 x 106 mol/yr leaving a potential excess (in-flow -
                  out-flow) of 2.06 x 109 mol/yr. Thus quantification of the
                  potential out-flow from the seep domains based on observable
                  processes does not equilibrate with the theoretical inputs
                  from the reservoir. Processes that might balance this budget

               to quantify environmental and behavioral factors using a latent

              helping to prevent model overfitting. We further enhance the model
              with a sub-network that accounts for covariates such as mobility
              and cumulative vaccine doses, which influence the transmission
              rate. Using state-level COVID-19 data from California, we
              demonstrate that the PINN model accurately predicts cases, deaths,
              and hospitalizations, aligning well with existing benchmarks.
              Notably, the PINN model outperforms naive baseline forecasts and
              several sequence deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural
              Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated

               coordination and integration of efforts required to effectively
               manage large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. A successful
               response to such crises demands the swift and ongoing syn- thesis
               of information and activities across multiple sectors, including
               government, healthcare, and private industry. However, these
               systems are often managed in isolation, leading to misaligned
               policies, fragmented communications, and inefficiencies that
               hinder pandemic response efforts. To address these challenges, we
               propose adopting a systems- of-systems (SOS) paradigm to enhance
               epidemic intelligence and improve preparedness and response
               during infectious disease emergencies. The SOS approach, widely
               used in engineering, offers a framework for integrating diverse
               fields such as virology, ecology, psychology, and policy. We
               illustrate the potential of this approach using highly pathogenic
               avian influenza (HPAI) as a case study and discuss key
               considerations for implementing SOS thinking in the context of
               global epidemic intelligence systems.",

                  ocean and atmosphere occurs at hydrocarbon seeps along
                  continental margins. Seeps are key features that alter the
                  seafloor morphology and geochemically affect the sediments
                  that support chemosynthetic communities. However, the dynamics
                  and discharge rates of hydrocarbons at cold seeps remain
                  largely unconstrained. Here we merge complementary geochemical
                  (oil fingerprinting), geophysical (seismic, subbottom,
                  backscatter, multibeam) and video/imaging (Video Time Lapse
                  Camera, DSV ALVIN video) data sets to constrain pathways and
                  magnitudes of hydrocarbon fluxes from the source rock to the
                  seafloor at a well-studied, prolific seep site in the Northern
                  Gulf of Mexico (GC600). Oil fingerprinting showed
                  compositional similarities for samples from the following
                  collections: the reservoir, an active vent, and the
                  sea-surface. This was consistent with reservoir structures and
                  pathways identified in seismic data. Video data, which showed
                  the spatial distribution of seep indicators such as bacteria
                  mats, or hydrate outcrops at the sediment interface, were
                  combined with known hydrocarbon fluxes from the literature and
                  used to quantify the total hydrocarbon fluxes in the seep
                  domain. Using a systems approach, we combined data sets and
                  published values at various scales and resolutions to compile
                  a preliminary hydrocarbon budget for the GC600 seep site.
                  Total estimated in-flow of hydrocarbons was 2.07 x 109 mol/yr.
                  The combined total of out-flow and sequestration amounted to
                  7.56 x 106 mol/yr leaving a potential excess (in-flow -
                  out-flow) of 2.06 x 109 mol/yr. Thus quantification of the
                  potential out-flow from the seep domains based on observable
                  processes does not equilibrate with the theoretical inputs
                  from the reservoir. Processes that might balance this budget
                  include accumulation of gas hydrate and sediment free-gas, as
                  well as greater efficiency of biological sinks.",
