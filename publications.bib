               hydrocarbons, support accelerated biogeochemical dynamics,
               creating unique geobiological habitats. Subseafloor geology

               hydrocarbon (gas and/or oil) seeps, brine seeps, and mud
               volcanoes. Biogeochemical processes across the redox spectrum are
               amplified at hydrocarbon seeps due to the abundance and diversity
               of reductant; anaerobic metabolism dominates within the sediment
               column since oxygen is consumed rapidly near the sediment
               surface. Microbial activity is constrained by electron acceptor
               availability, with rapid recycling required to support observed
               rates of hydrocarbon consumption. Geobiologic structures, from
               gas hydrate to solid asphalt to authigenic minerals, form as a
               result of hydrocarbon and associated fluid discharge.

               deep sea oases that support immense biodiversity and where

               in the mosquito species that transmit pathogens to humans and
               wildlife. Recent modeling studies have sought to improve our
               understanding of the relationship between temperature and the
               transmission potential of mosquito‐borne pathogens. However, the
               role of the vertebrate host population, including the importance
               of host behavioral defenses on mosquito feeding success, remains
               poorly understood despite ample empirical evidence of its
               significance to pathogen transmission. Here, we derived thermal
               performance curves for mosquito and parasite traits and
               integrated them into two models of vector–host contact to
               investigate how vertebrate host traits and behaviors affect two
               key thermal properties of mosquito‐borne parasite transmission:
               the thermal optimum for transmission and the thermal niche of the
               parasite population. We parameterized these models for five
               mosquito‐borne parasite transmission systems, leading to two main
               conclusions. First, vertebrate host availability may induce a
               shift in the thermal optimum of transmission. When the tolerance
               of the vertebrate host to biting from mosquitoes is limited, the
               thermal optimum of transmission may be altered by as much as 5°C,
               a magnitude of applied significance. Second, thresholds for
               sustained transmission depend nonlinearly on both vertebrate host
               availability and temperature. At any temperature, sustained
               transmission is impossible when vertebrate hosts are extremely
               abundant because the probability of encountering an infected
               individual is negligible. But when host biting tolerance is
               limited, sustained transmission will also not occur at low host
               population densities. Furthermore, our model indicates that
               biting tolerance should interact with vertebrate host population
               density to adjust the parasite population thermal niche.
               Together, these results suggest that vertebrate host traits and
               behaviors play essential roles in the thermal properties of
               mosquito‐borne parasite transmission. Increasing our
               understanding of this relationship should lead us to improved
               predictions about shifting global patterns of mosquito‐borne
               disease.",

              binomial distribution, simply because its variance is larger than
              the mean and it can be long-tailed. However, populations are often
              partitioned into groups by social, behavioral, or environmental
              risk factors, particularly in closed settings such as workplaces
              or care homes. While heterogeneities in infectious histories and
              contact structure have been considered separately, models for
              superspreading events that include the joint effects of social and
              biological risk factors are lacking. To address this need, we
              developed a mechanistic finite mixture model for the number of
              secondary infections that unites population partitioning with
              individual-level heterogeneity in infectious period duration. We
              showed that the variance in the number of secondary infections is
              composed of both sources of heterogeneity: risk group structuring
              and infectiousness. We used the model to construct the outbreak
              size distribution and to derive critical thresholds for
              elimination resulting from control activities that differentially
              target the high-contact subpopulation vs. the population at large.
              We compared our model with the standard negative binomial
              distribution and showed that the tail behavior of the outbreak
              size distribution under a finite mixture model differs
              substantially. Our results indicate that even if the infectious
              period follows a bell-shaped distribution, heterogeneity in
              outbreak sizes may arise due to the influence of population risk

               Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom
               by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which
               visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with
               nodes representing individuals and branches representing
               transmission from person to person. We compiled a database,
               called OutbreakTrees, of 382 published, standardized transmission
               trees consisting of 16 directly transmitted diseases ranging in
               size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease, we
               calculated several key statistics, such as tree size, average
               number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the
               proportion of cases considered superspreaders, and examined how
               these statistics varied over the course of each outbreak and
               under different assumptions about the completeness of outbreak
               investigations. We demonstrated the potential utility of the

               superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including
               Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). First, we found that our
               transmission trees were consistent with theory predicting that
               intermediate dispersion parameters give rise to the highest
               proportion of cases causing superspreading events. Additionally,
               we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected.

               support for the theory that superspreaders generate other

               superspreading in COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that
               of other diseases and suggest an approach to further research

               human-wildlife interactions, often increasing zoonotic spillover
               potential. When deforested land reverts to forest, species
               composition differences between primary and regenerating
               (secondary) forest could alter spillover risk trajectory. We
               develop a mathematical model of land-use change, where habitats
               differ in their relative spillover risk, to understand how land
               reversion influences spillover risk. We apply this framework to
               scenarios where spillover risk is higher in deforested land than
               mature forest, reflecting higher relative abundance of highly
               competent species and/or increased human-wildlife encounters, and
               where regenerating forest has either very low or high spillover
               risk. We find the forest regeneration rate, the spillover risk of
               regenerating forest relative to deforested land, and how rapidly
               regenerating forest regains attributes of mature forest determine
               landscape-level spillover risk. When regenerating forest has a
               much lower spillover risk than deforested land, reversion lowers
               cumulative spillover risk, but instaneous spillover risk peaks
               earlier. However, when spillover risk is high in regenerating and
               cleared habitats, landscape-level spillover risk remains high,
               especially when cleared land is rapidly abandoned then slowly
               regenerates to mature forest. These results suggest that
               proactive wildlife management and awareness of human exposure
               risk in regenerating forests could be important tools for
               spillover mitigation.",

               (COVID-19) in the period up to its decline following mass
               vaccination was a task that received much attention but proved
               difficult to do with high accuracy. However, the availability of
               standardized forecasts and versioned datasets from this period
               allows for continued work in this area. Here, we introduce the
               Gaussian infection state space with time dependence (GISST)
               forecasting model. We evaluate its performance in one to four
               weeks ahead forecasts of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and
               deaths in the state of California made with official reports of
               COVID-19, Google's mobility reports and vaccination data
               available each week. Evaluation of these forecasts with a
               weighted interval score shows them to consistently outperform a
               naive baseline forecast and often score closer to or better than
               a high-performing ensemble forecaster. The GISST model also
               provides parameter estimates for a compartmental model of
               COVID-19 dynamics, includes a regression submodel for the
               transmission rate and allows for parameters to vary over time
               according to a random walk. GISST provides a novel, balanced
               combination of computational efficiency, model interpretability

               useful in improving the accuracy of infectious disease forecasts.",

               significant, long-lasting impacts on our social, economic,
               environmental and political systems. Identifying and averting
               spillover transmission is crucial for preventing outbreaks and
               mitigating infectious disease burdens. Investigating the
               processes that lead to spillover fundamentally involves
               interactions between animals, humans, pathogens and the
               environments they inhabit. Accordingly, it is recognized that
               transdisciplinary approaches provide a more holistic
               understanding of spillover phenomena. To characterize the
               discourse about spillover within and between disciplines, we
               conducted a review of review papers about spillover from multiple
               disciplines. We systematically searched and screened literature
               from several databases to identify a corpus of review papers from
               ten academic disciplines. We performed qualitative content
               analysis on text where authors described either a spillover
               pathway, or a conceptual gap in spillover theory. Cluster
               analysis of pathway data identified nine major spillover
               processes discussed in the review literature. We summarized the
               main features of each process, how different disciplines
               contributed to them, and identified specialist and generalist
               disciplines based on the breadth of processes they studied.
               Network analyses showed strong similarities between concepts
               reviewed by 'One Health' disciplines (e.g. Veterinary Science \&
               Animal Health, Public Health \& Medicine, Ecology \& Evolution,
               Environmental Science), which had broad conceptual scope and were
               well-connected to other disciplines. By contrast, awas focused on
               processes that are relatively overlooked by other disciplines,
               especially those involving food behaviour and livestock husbandry
               practices. Virology and Cellular \& Molecular Biology were
               narrower in scope, primarily focusing on concepts related to
               adaption and evolution of zoonotic viruses. Finally, we
               identified priority areas for future research into zoonotic
               spillover by studying the gap data.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Yellow fever virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus
               that persists in an enzoonotic cycle in non-human primates (NHPs)
               in Brazil, causing disease in humans through spillover events.
               Yellow fever (YF) re-emerged in the early 2000s, spreading from
               the Amazon River basin towards the previously considered
               low-risk, southeastern region of the country. Previous methods
               mapping YF spillover risk do not incorporate the temporal
               dynamics and ecological context of the disease, and are therefore
               unable to predict seasonality in spatial risk across Brazil. We
               present the results of a bagged logistic regression predicting
               the propensity for YF spillover per municipality (administrative
               sub-district) in Brazil from environmental and demographic
               covariates aggregated by month. Ecological context was
               incorporated by creating National and Regional models of
               spillover dynamics, where the Regional model consisted of two
               separate models determined by the regions' NHP reservoir species
               richness (high vs low). RESULTS: Of the 5560 municipalities, 82
               reported YF cases from 2001 to 2013. Model accuracy was high for
               the National and low reservoir richness (LRR) models (AUC =
               0.80), while the high reservoir richness (HRR) model accuracy was
               lower (AUC = 0.63). The National model predicted consistently
               high spillover risk in the Amazon, while the Regional model
               predicted strong seasonality in spillover risk. Within the
               Regional model, seasonality of spillover risk in the HRR region
               was asynchronous to the LRR region. However, the observed
               seasonality of spillover risk in the LRR Regional model mirrored
               the national model predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted risk
               of YF spillover varies with space and time. Seasonal trends
               differ between regions indicating, at times, spillover risk can
               be higher in the urban coastal regions than the Amazon River
               basin which is counterintuitive based on current YF risk maps.
               Understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of YF spillover risk
