  abstract      = "The lunar cycle has long been suspected to influence
                   biological phenomena. Folklore alludes to such a
                   relationship, but previous scientific analyses have failed to
                   find significant associations. It has been shown that lunar
                   cycles indeed have effects on animals; significant
                   associations between human circadian rhythms and lunar cycles
                   have also been reported. We set out to determine whether a
                   significant statistical correlation exists between the lunar
                   phase and sex determination during conception. We found that
                   significant associations (\textit{p}-value $< 5 \times
                   10^{-5}$) exist between the average sex ratio (male:female)
                   and the lunar month. The likelihood of conception of a male
                   is at its highest point five days after the full moon,
                   whereas the highest likelihood of female conception occurs
                   nineteen days after the full moon. Furthermore, we found that
                   the strength of this influence is correlated with the amount
                   of solar radiation (which is proportional to moonlight). Our
                   results suggest that sex determination may be influenced by
                   the moon cycle, which suggests the possibility of lunar
                   influence on other biological phenomena. We suggest for
                   future research the exploration of similar effects in other
                   phenomena involving humans and other species.",

              disease systems. As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases,
              the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering
              chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One
              proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning
              signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic
              changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically
              predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the
              nature of epidemiological data, which are typically aggregated
              into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The
              viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains
              uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence
              even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance
              using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how
              well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an
              emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC
              statistic are compared across a range of different reporting
              scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data
              differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all
              perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The
              autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well
              provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than
              the serial interval and reporting error is not highly
              overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis
              are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we
              find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most
              realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect
              epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many

              (Video Time Lapse Camera, DSV ALVIN video) data sets to constrain

              to the seafloor at a well-studied, prolific seep site in the

              This was consistent with reservoir structures and pathways

              Birthday Candles (BC) and Mega-Plume (MP), which are separated by
              1km on a salt supported ridge trending from NW-SE. Seismic data
              depicts two faults, also separated by 1km, feeding into the
              surface gas hydrate region. BC and MP comprise the range between
              oily, mixed, and gaseous-type vents. In both cases bubbles are
              observed escaping from gas hydrate out crops at the sea floor and
              supporting chemosynthetic communities. Fluid flow is indicated by
              features on the sea floor such as hydrate mounds, authigenic
              carbonates, brine pools, mud volcanoes, and biology. We propose a
              model to describe the upward flow of hydrocarbons from three
              vertical scales, each dominated by different factors: 1) macro
              (capillary failure in overlying cap rocks causing reservoir
              leakage), 2) meso (buoyancy driven fault migration), and 3) micro
              (hydrate formation and chemosynthetic activity). At the macro
              scale we use high reflectivity in seismic data and sediment pore
              throat radii to determine the formation of fractures in leaky
              reservoirs. Once oil and gas leave the reservoir through fractures
              in the cap rock they migrate in separate phases. At the meso scale
              we use seismic data to locate faults and salt diapirs that form
              conduits for buoyant hydrocarbons follow. This connects the path
              to the micro scale where we used video data to observe bubble
              release from individual vents for extended periods of time
              (3h-26d), and developed an image processing program to quantify
              bubble release rates. At mixed vents gaseous bubbles are observed
              escaping hydrate outcrops with a coating of oil varying in
              thickness. Bubble oil and gas ratios are estimated using average
              bubble size and release rates. The relative vent age can be
              described by carbonate hard ground cover, biological activity, and
              hydrate mound formation as these features progress with persistent
              hydrocarbon influx. Bottom features along with seismic data,
              bubble release rates and bubble composition (oily vs gaseous), are
              implemented into our model to describe the relative vent age and
              dynamic mechanisms of hydrocarbon migration at three vertical
