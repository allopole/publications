              are hard to model and difficult to predict. Their dynamics might
              appear intractable. However, new statistical approaches-rooted in
              dynamical systems and the theory of stochastic processes-have
              yielded insight into the dynamics of emerging and re-emerging
              pathogens. We argue that these approaches may lead to new methods
              for predicting epidemics. This perspective views pathogen
              emergence and re-emergence as a ``critical transition,'' and uses
              the concept of noisy dynamic bifurcation to understand the
              relationship between the system observables and the distance to
              this transition. Because the system dynamics exhibit
              characteristic fluctuations in response to perturbations for a
              system in the vicinity of a critical point, we propose this
              information may be harnessed to develop early warning signals.
              Specifically, the motion of perturbations slows as the system
              approaches the transition.",

              disease systems. As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases,
              the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering
              chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One
              proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning
              signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic
              changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically
              predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the
              nature of epidemiological data, which are typically aggregated
              into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The
              viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains
              uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence
              even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance
              using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how
              well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an
              emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC
              statistic are compared across a range of different reporting
              scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data
              differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all
              perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The
              autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well
              provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than
              the serial interval and reporting error is not highly
              overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis
              are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we
              find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most
              realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect
              epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many
              potentially emerging diseases.",

                  compositional similarities for samples from the following
                  collections: the reservoir, an active vent, and the
                  sea-surface. This was consistent with reservoir structures and
                  pathways identified in seismic data. Video data, which showed
                  the spatial distribution of seep indicators such as bacteria
                  mats, or hydrate outcrops at the sediment interface, were
                  combined with known hydrocarbon fluxes from the literature and
                  used to quantify the total hydrocarbon fluxes in the seep
                  domain. Using a systems approach, we combined data sets and
                  published values at various scales and resolutions to compile
                  a preliminary hydrocarbon budget for the GC600 seep site.
                  Total estimated in-flow of hydrocarbons was 2.07 x 109 mol/yr.
                  The combined total of out-flow and sequestration amounted to
                  7.56 x 106 mol/yr leaving a potential excess (in-flow -
                  out-flow) of 2.06 x 109 mol/yr. Thus quantification of the
                  potential out-flow from the seep domains based on observable
                  processes does not equilibrate with the theoretical inputs
                  from the reservoir. Processes that might balance this budget
                  include accumulation of gas hydrate and sediment free-gas, as

               in the mosquito species that transmit pathogens to humans and
               wildlife. Recent modeling studies have sought to improve our
               understanding of the relationship between temperature and the
               transmission potential of mosquito‐borne pathogens. However, the
               role of the vertebrate host population, including the importance
               of host behavioral defenses on mosquito feeding success, remains
               poorly understood despite ample empirical evidence of its
               significance to pathogen transmission. Here, we derived thermal
               performance curves for mosquito and parasite traits and
               integrated them into two models of vector–host contact to
               investigate how vertebrate host traits and behaviors affect two
               key thermal properties of mosquito‐borne parasite transmission:
               the thermal optimum for transmission and the thermal niche of the
               parasite population. We parameterized these models for five
               mosquito‐borne parasite transmission systems, leading to two main
               conclusions. First, vertebrate host availability may induce a
               shift in the thermal optimum of transmission. When the tolerance
               of the vertebrate host to biting from mosquitoes is limited, the
               thermal optimum of transmission may be altered by as much as 5°C,
               a magnitude of applied significance. Second, thresholds for
               sustained transmission depend nonlinearly on both vertebrate host
               availability and temperature. At any temperature, sustained
               transmission is impossible when vertebrate hosts are extremely
               abundant because the probability of encountering an infected
               individual is negligible. But when host biting tolerance is
               limited, sustained transmission will also not occur at low host
               population densities. Furthermore, our model indicates that
               biting tolerance should interact with vertebrate host population
               density to adjust the parasite population thermal niche.
               Together, these results suggest that vertebrate host traits and
               behaviors play essential roles in the thermal properties of
               mosquito‐borne parasite transmission. Increasing our
               understanding of this relationship should lead us to improved
               predictions about shifting global patterns of mosquito‐borne
               disease.",

              binomial distribution, simply because its variance is larger than

              partitioned into groups by social, behavioral, or environmental
              risk factors, particularly in closed settings such as workplaces
              or care homes. While heterogeneities in infectious histories and
              contact structure have been considered separately, models for
              superspreading events that include the joint effects of social and
              biological risk factors are lacking. To address this need, we
              developed a mechanistic finite mixture model for the number of
              secondary infections that unites population partitioning with
              individual-level heterogeneity in infectious period duration. We
              showed that the variance in the number of secondary infections is
              composed of both sources of heterogeneity: risk group structuring
              and infectiousness. We used the model to construct the outbreak
              size distribution and to derive critical thresholds for
              elimination resulting from control activities that differentially
              target the high-contact subpopulation vs. the population at large.
              We compared our model with the standard negative binomial
              distribution and showed that the tail behavior of the outbreak

               a generic feature of dynamical systems approaching a tipping
               point-early warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down

               Here, we use fitted, mechanistic models of measles transmission
               in four cities in Niger to detect CSD through statistical EWS. We
               find that several EWS accurately anticipate measles re-emergence

               disease transmission systems cross key tipping points. These

               Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom
               by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which
               visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with
               nodes representing individuals and branches representing
               transmission from person to person. We compiled a database,
               called OutbreakTrees, of 382 published, standardized transmission
               trees consisting of 16 directly transmitted diseases ranging in
               size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease, we
               calculated several key statistics, such as tree size, average
               number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the
               proportion of cases considered superspreaders, and examined how
               these statistics varied over the course of each outbreak and
               under different assumptions about the completeness of outbreak
               investigations. We demonstrated the potential utility of the
               database through 2 short analyses addressing questions about
               superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including
               Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). First, we found that our
               transmission trees were consistent with theory predicting that
               intermediate dispersion parameters give rise to the highest
               proportion of cases causing superspreading events. Additionally,
               we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected.

               support for the theory that superspreaders generate other
               superspreaders. In sum, our findings put the role of
               superspreading in COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that
               of other diseases and suggest an approach to further research

               bound the range of dynamical phenomena associated with hosts,

                   find significant associations. It has been shown that lunar

                   associations between human circadian rhythms and lunar cycles
                   have also been reported. We set out to determine whether a
                   significant statistical correlation exists between the lunar
                   phase and sex determination during conception. We found that
                   significant associations (\textit{p}-value $< 5 \times
                   10^{-5}$) exist between the average sex ratio (male:female)

              Notably, the PINN model outperforms naive baseline forecasts and

               manage large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. A successful
               response to such crises demands the swift and ongoing syn- thesis
               of information and activities across multiple sectors, including
               government, healthcare, and private industry. However, these
               systems are often managed in isolation, leading to misaligned
               policies, fragmented communications, and inefficiencies that
               hinder pandemic response efforts. To address these challenges, we
               propose adopting a systems- of-systems (SOS) paradigm to enhance
               epidemic intelligence and improve preparedness and response
               during infectious disease emergencies. The SOS approach, widely
               used in engineering, offers a framework for integrating diverse
               fields such as virology, ecology, psychology, and policy. We
               illustrate the potential of this approach using highly pathogenic
               avian influenza (HPAI) as a case study and discuss key
               considerations for implementing SOS thinking in the context of
               global epidemic intelligence systems.",

                  interventions. Despite a universal recommendation since 2010,
                  annual influenza uptake in the US remains below 50\%. In
                  contrast, COVID-19 vaccination campaigns initially achieved
                  high participation but later encountered significant
                  hesitancy. Understanding these patterns requires new
                  theoretical frameworks that capture how individuals make
                  health decisions in different contexts. In this study, we
                  analyze results from a survey on influenza and COVID-19
                  vaccination attitudes and behaviors, introducing a novel
                  theoretical framework based on health decision-making

                  preferences in how they approach medical decisions, which
                  shape their vaccine confidence, hesitancy, prior vaccination
                  behaviors, and future intentions. We present a new instrument

                  framework supports new dynamical models that segment
                  populations into attitudinal clusters. Such models help
                  explain how vaccine decision-making evolves over time and
                  across public health contexts, informing more effective health
                  communication and policy. By integrating psychological and
                  epidemiological perspectives, this work offers a new approach

               composition differences between primary and regenerating
               (secondary) forest could alter spillover risk trajectory. We
               develop a mathematical model of land-use change, where habitats
               differ in their relative spillover risk, to understand how land
               reversion influences spillover risk. We apply this framework to
               scenarios where spillover risk is higher in deforested land than
               mature forest, reflecting higher relative abundance of highly
               competent species and/or increased human-wildlife encounters, and
               where regenerating forest has either very low or high spillover
               risk. We find the forest regeneration rate, the spillover risk of
               regenerating forest relative to deforested land, and how rapidly
               regenerating forest regains attributes of mature forest determine
               landscape-level spillover risk. When regenerating forest has a
               much lower spillover risk than deforested land, reversion lowers
               cumulative spillover risk, but instaneous spillover risk peaks
               earlier. However, when spillover risk is high in regenerating and
               cleared habitats, landscape-level spillover risk remains high,
               especially when cleared land is rapidly abandoned then slowly
               regenerates to mature forest. These results suggest that
               proactive wildlife management and awareness of human exposure
               risk in regenerating forests could be important tools for
               spillover mitigation.",

               (COVID-19) in the period up to its decline following mass
               vaccination was a task that received much attention but proved
               difficult to do with high accuracy. However, the availability of
               standardized forecasts and versioned datasets from this period
               allows for continued work in this area. Here, we introduce the
               Gaussian infection state space with time dependence (GISST)
               forecasting model. We evaluate its performance in one to four
               weeks ahead forecasts of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and
               deaths in the state of California made with official reports of
               COVID-19, Google's mobility reports and vaccination data

               a high-performing ensemble forecaster. The GISST model also
               provides parameter estimates for a compartmental model of

               significant, long-lasting impacts on our social, economic,
               environmental and political systems. Identifying and averting
               spillover transmission is crucial for preventing outbreaks and
               mitigating infectious disease burdens. Investigating the
               processes that lead to spillover fundamentally involves
               interactions between animals, humans, pathogens and the
               environments they inhabit. Accordingly, it is recognized that
               transdisciplinary approaches provide a more holistic
               understanding of spillover phenomena. To characterize the
               discourse about spillover within and between disciplines, we
               conducted a review of review papers about spillover from multiple
               disciplines. We systematically searched and screened literature
               from several databases to identify a corpus of review papers from
               ten academic disciplines. We performed qualitative content
               analysis on text where authors described either a spillover
               pathway, or a conceptual gap in spillover theory. Cluster
               analysis of pathway data identified nine major spillover
               processes discussed in the review literature. We summarized the
               main features of each process, how different disciplines
               contributed to them, and identified specialist and generalist
               disciplines based on the breadth of processes they studied.
               Network analyses showed strong similarities between concepts
               reviewed by 'One Health' disciplines (e.g. Veterinary Science \&
               Animal Health, Public Health \& Medicine, Ecology \& Evolution,
               Environmental Science), which had broad conceptual scope and were
               well-connected to other disciplines. By contrast, awas focused on
               processes that are relatively overlooked by other disciplines,
               especially those involving food behaviour and livestock husbandry
               practices. Virology and Cellular \& Molecular Biology were
               narrower in scope, primarily focusing on concepts related to
               adaption and evolution of zoonotic viruses. Finally, we
               identified priority areas for future research into zoonotic
               spillover by studying the gap data.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Yellow fever virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus
               that persists in an enzoonotic cycle in non-human primates (NHPs)
               in Brazil, causing disease in humans through spillover events.
               Yellow fever (YF) re-emerged in the early 2000s, spreading from
               the Amazon River basin towards the previously considered
               low-risk, southeastern region of the country. Previous methods
               mapping YF spillover risk do not incorporate the temporal
               dynamics and ecological context of the disease, and are therefore
               unable to predict seasonality in spatial risk across Brazil. We
               present the results of a bagged logistic regression predicting
               the propensity for YF spillover per municipality (administrative
               sub-district) in Brazil from environmental and demographic
               covariates aggregated by month. Ecological context was
               incorporated by creating National and Regional models of
               spillover dynamics, where the Regional model consisted of two
               separate models determined by the regions' NHP reservoir species
               richness (high vs low). RESULTS: Of the 5560 municipalities, 82
               reported YF cases from 2001 to 2013. Model accuracy was high for
               the National and low reservoir richness (LRR) models (AUC =
               0.80), while the high reservoir richness (HRR) model accuracy was
               lower (AUC = 0.63). The National model predicted consistently
               high spillover risk in the Amazon, while the Regional model
               predicted strong seasonality in spillover risk. Within the
               Regional model, seasonality of spillover risk in the HRR region
               was asynchronous to the LRR region. However, the observed
               seasonality of spillover risk in the LRR Regional model mirrored
               the national model predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted risk
               of YF spillover varies with space and time. Seasonal trends
               differ between regions indicating, at times, spillover risk can
               be higher in the urban coastal regions than the Amazon River
               basin which is counterintuitive based on current YF risk maps.
               Understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of YF spillover risk
               could better inform allocation of public health services.",

               suppressing transmission include active case finding, contact
               tracing, quarantine, immunity or health certification, and a wide
               range of personal protective measures. Here we investigate the
               potential effectiveness of these alternative approaches to
               suppression. We introduce a conceptual framework represented by
               two mathematical models that differ in strategy. We find both
               strategies may be effective, although both require extensive
               testing and work within a relatively narrow range of conditions.
               Generalized protective measures such as wearing face masks,
               improved hygiene and local reductions in density are found to

  abstract  = "Accurate forecasting of contagious illnesses has become
               increasingly important to public health policymaking and better
               prediction could prevent the loss of millions of lives. To better
               prepare for future pandemics, it is essential to improve
               forecasting methods and capabilities. In this work, we implement
               physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a popular tool in the
               area of scientific machine learning, to perform infectious
               disease forecasting. The used PINNs model incorporates dynamical
               systems representations of disease transmission into the loss
               function, thereby assimilating epidemiological theory and data
               using neural networks. Our approach is designed to prevent model
               overfitting, which often occurs when training deep-learning
               models with observation data alone. In addition, we use an
               additional sub-network to account for mobility, cumulative
               vaccine doses and other covariates that influence the
               transmission rate, a key parameter in the compartmental model. To
               demonstrate the capability of the proposed model, we examine the
               performance of the model using state-level COVID-19 data in
               California. Our simulation results show that predictions of the
               PINNs model on the number of cases, deaths and hospitalizations
               are consistent with existing benchmarks. In particular, the PINNs
               model outperforms naive baseline forecasts and various sequence
               deep-learning models, such as recurrent neural networks, long
               short-term memory networks, gated recurrent units and transformer
               models. We also show that the performance of the PINNs model is
               comparable with that of a sophisticated Gaussian infection state
               forecasting model that combines the compartmental model, a data
               observation model and a regression model for inferring parameters
               in the compartmental model. Nonetheless, the PINNs model offers a
               simpler structure and is easier to implement. In summary, we
               perform a systematic study of the predictive capability of the
               PINNs model in forecasting the dynamics of infectious diseases
               and our results showcase the potential of the proposed model as
               an efficient computational tool to enhance the current capacity
               of infectious disease forecasting.",
