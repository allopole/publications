               hydrocarbons, support accelerated biogeochemical dynamics,
               creating unique geobiological habitats. Subseafloor geology
               dictates the surficial expression of seeps, generating
               hydrocarbon (gas and/or oil) seeps, brine seeps, and mud
               volcanoes. Biogeochemical processes across the redox spectrum are
               amplified at hydrocarbon seeps due to the abundance and diversity
               of reductant; anaerobic metabolism dominates within the sediment
               column since oxygen is consumed rapidly near the sediment
               surface. Microbial activity is constrained by electron acceptor
               availability, with rapid recycling required to support observed
               rates of hydrocarbon consumption. Geobiologic structures, from
               gas hydrate to solid asphalt to authigenic minerals, form as a

               in the mosquito species that transmit pathogens to humans and
               wildlife. Recent modeling studies have sought to improve our
               understanding of the relationship between temperature and the
               transmission potential of mosquito‐borne pathogens. However, the
               role of the vertebrate host population, including the importance
               of host behavioral defenses on mosquito feeding success, remains
               poorly understood despite ample empirical evidence of its
               significance to pathogen transmission. Here, we derived thermal
               performance curves for mosquito and parasite traits and
               integrated them into two models of vector–host contact to
               investigate how vertebrate host traits and behaviors affect two
               key thermal properties of mosquito‐borne parasite transmission:
               the thermal optimum for transmission and the thermal niche of the
               parasite population. We parameterized these models for five
               mosquito‐borne parasite transmission systems, leading to two main
               conclusions. First, vertebrate host availability may induce a
               shift in the thermal optimum of transmission. When the tolerance
               of the vertebrate host to biting from mosquitoes is limited, the
               thermal optimum of transmission may be altered by as much as 5°C,
               a magnitude of applied significance. Second, thresholds for
               sustained transmission depend nonlinearly on both vertebrate host
               availability and temperature. At any temperature, sustained
               transmission is impossible when vertebrate hosts are extremely
               abundant because the probability of encountering an infected
               individual is negligible. But when host biting tolerance is
               limited, sustained transmission will also not occur at low host
               population densities. Furthermore, our model indicates that
               biting tolerance should interact with vertebrate host population
               density to adjust the parasite population thermal niche.
               Together, these results suggest that vertebrate host traits and
               behaviors play essential roles in the thermal properties of
               mosquito‐borne parasite transmission. Increasing our
               understanding of this relationship should lead us to improved
               predictions about shifting global patterns of mosquito‐borne
               disease.",

              binomial distribution, simply because its variance is larger than
              the mean and it can be long-tailed. However, populations are often
              partitioned into groups by social, behavioral, or environmental
              risk factors, particularly in closed settings such as workplaces
              or care homes. While heterogeneities in infectious histories and
              contact structure have been considered separately, models for
              superspreading events that include the joint effects of social and
              biological risk factors are lacking. To address this need, we
              developed a mechanistic finite mixture model for the number of
              secondary infections that unites population partitioning with
              individual-level heterogeneity in infectious period duration. We
              showed that the variance in the number of secondary infections is
              composed of both sources of heterogeneity: risk group structuring
              and infectiousness. We used the model to construct the outbreak
              size distribution and to derive critical thresholds for
              elimination resulting from control activities that differentially
              target the high-contact subpopulation vs. the population at large.
              We compared our model with the standard negative binomial
              distribution and showed that the tail behavior of the outbreak

              period follows a bell-shaped distribution, heterogeneity in

  abstract = "AbstractThe emergence of mosquito-borne zoonoses has continually
              increased over the past decade, posing a significant global public
              health challenge. Ecological theory can point to the
              characteristics of populations that make them more likely to form
              reservoirs of disease. The pace of life hypothesis posits that
              species with more rapid reproduction and shorter lifespans are
              more likely to be disease reservoirs than their slower-living
              cousins. Mathematical modeling suggests theoretical conditions
              under which this hypothesis is correct for directly- and
              environmentally-transmitted pathogens but its applicability to
              mosquito-borne disease systems has yet to be examined. We
              parameterized a mechanistic model with host trait data to
              investigate the link between the position of a species on the
              fast-slow life history continuum and the potential for it to
              spread mosquitoborne diseases. We evaluated the resulting
              relationships for four medically important mosquito species across
              their thermal niches and for four pathogens characterized by
              infection duration and the level of susceptibility of the focal
              host to infection. Finally, because the fast-slow life history
              continuum differs across taxonomic ranks, we considered the theory
              in the context of two orders of vertebrate hosts, Rodentia and
              Primates. After parameterizing our model, we found that, near
              universally across all the axes of variation considered,
              fast-lived hosts have higher transmission potential than
              slow-lived hosts. There was one exception: slower-lived hosts have
              higher transmission potential for parasites that cause
              long-enduring infections to which these hosts are highly
              susceptible. Generally, however, these connections hinge on the
              often unknown links between immunological traits, population
              density, and pace of life. Our analyses highlight immunological
              traits as a key knowledge gap with strong influence over the
              potential for transmission. Further investigation of the pace of
              life hypothesis will require a better understanding of how, for
              mosquito-borne parasitic infections, susceptibility and infection
              duration vary across the members of a taxonomic order.",

               size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease, we

               chapter topics provide an up-to-date presentation of classical
               concepts, reviews of emerging trends, synthesis of existing
               knowledge, and a prospective agenda for future research. The
               contributions offer authoritative and international perspectives
               from leading thinkers in the field. The dynamics of vector-borne
               diseases are far more intrinsically ecological compared with
               their directly transmitted equivalents. The environmental
               dependence of ectotherm vectors means that vector-borne pathogens
               are acutely sensitive to changing environmental conditions.
               Although perennially important vector-borne diseases such as
               malaria and dengue have deeply informed our understanding of
               vector-borne diseases, recent emerging viruses such as West Nile
               virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus have generated new
               scientific questions and practical problems. The study of
               vector-borne disease has been a particularly rich source of
               ecological questions, while ecological theory has provided the
               conceptual tools for thinking about their evolution,

               human-wildlife interactions, often increasing zoonotic spillover
               potential. When deforested land reverts to forest, species
               composition differences between primary and regenerating
               (secondary) forest could alter spillover risk trajectory. We
               develop a mathematical model of land-use change, where habitats
               differ in their relative spillover risk, to understand how land
               reversion influences spillover risk. We apply this framework to
               scenarios where spillover risk is higher in deforested land than
               mature forest, reflecting higher relative abundance of highly
               competent species and/or increased human-wildlife encounters, and
               where regenerating forest has either very low or high spillover
               risk. We find the forest regeneration rate, the spillover risk of
               regenerating forest relative to deforested land, and how rapidly
               regenerating forest regains attributes of mature forest determine
               landscape-level spillover risk. When regenerating forest has a
               much lower spillover risk than deforested land, reversion lowers
               cumulative spillover risk, but instaneous spillover risk peaks
               earlier. However, when spillover risk is high in regenerating and
               cleared habitats, landscape-level spillover risk remains high,
               especially when cleared land is rapidly abandoned then slowly
               regenerates to mature forest. These results suggest that
               proactive wildlife management and awareness of human exposure
               risk in regenerating forests could be important tools for
               spillover mitigation.",

               (COVID-19) in the period up to its decline following mass
               vaccination was a task that received much attention but proved
               difficult to do with high accuracy. However, the availability of
               standardized forecasts and versioned datasets from this period
               allows for continued work in this area. Here, we introduce the
               Gaussian infection state space with time dependence (GISST)
               forecasting model. We evaluate its performance in one to four
               weeks ahead forecasts of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and
               deaths in the state of California made with official reports of
               COVID-19, Google's mobility reports and vaccination data
               available each week. Evaluation of these forecasts with a
               weighted interval score shows them to consistently outperform a
               naive baseline forecast and often score closer to or better than
               a high-performing ensemble forecaster. The GISST model also
               provides parameter estimates for a compartmental model of
               COVID-19 dynamics, includes a regression submodel for the
               transmission rate and allows for parameters to vary over time
               according to a random walk. GISST provides a novel, balanced
               combination of computational efficiency, model interpretability
               and applicability to large multivariate datasets that may prove
               useful in improving the accuracy of infectious disease forecasts.",

               significant, long-lasting impacts on our social, economic,
               environmental and political systems. Identifying and averting
               spillover transmission is crucial for preventing outbreaks and
               mitigating infectious disease burdens. Investigating the
               processes that lead to spillover fundamentally involves
               interactions between animals, humans, pathogens and the
               environments they inhabit. Accordingly, it is recognized that
               transdisciplinary approaches provide a more holistic
               understanding of spillover phenomena. To characterize the
               discourse about spillover within and between disciplines, we
               conducted a review of review papers about spillover from multiple
               disciplines. We systematically searched and screened literature
               from several databases to identify a corpus of review papers from
               ten academic disciplines. We performed qualitative content
               analysis on text where authors described either a spillover
               pathway, or a conceptual gap in spillover theory. Cluster
               analysis of pathway data identified nine major spillover
               processes discussed in the review literature. We summarized the
               main features of each process, how different disciplines
               contributed to them, and identified specialist and generalist
               disciplines based on the breadth of processes they studied.
               Network analyses showed strong similarities between concepts
               reviewed by 'One Health' disciplines (e.g. Veterinary Science \&
               Animal Health, Public Health \& Medicine, Ecology \& Evolution,
               Environmental Science), which had broad conceptual scope and were
               well-connected to other disciplines. By contrast, awas focused on
               processes that are relatively overlooked by other disciplines,
               especially those involving food behaviour and livestock husbandry
               practices. Virology and Cellular \& Molecular Biology were
               narrower in scope, primarily focusing on concepts related to
               adaption and evolution of zoonotic viruses. Finally, we
               identified priority areas for future research into zoonotic
               spillover by studying the gap data.",
